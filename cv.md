## __Code examples__
- __Python__  
Here is a piece of my game project. Here the player's income for a certain time is calculated. After some time has elapsed, the player is given a reward.
```
profit = ((st_numb*70)*st_lvl)+((busy_trains*75)*train_lvl)
    if timer_cooldown > 0 and stations_numb > 1:
        timer_cooldown -= 1

    elif busy_trains >= 1 or stations_numb > 1:
        money += profit
        timer_cooldown = FPS*25
        if ingame == True or instore == True:
            random.choice(sound_list_payday).play()
        else:
            pass
    else:
        pass
```
- __C++__  
This simple algorithm calculates the length of the given string.
```
size_t lenString(string str) {
	size_t len = 0;
	for (size_t i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++)
	{
		++len;
	}
	return len;
}

```
